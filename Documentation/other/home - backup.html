        <p>This is digitalized version of well-known boardgame "Battleships". As it has many variations to the rules, here are some that I decided to go with.</p>
        <ul class="HRules">
          <li class="HListHeader">Ships:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Each player has 5 sips: Aircraft Carrier (Size 5), Battleship (Size 4), Crusier (Size 3), Submarine (Size 3), Destroyer (Size 2)</li>
            <li>Ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically (no diagonal placement)</li>
            <li>Ships cannot be placed adjacent to each other</li>
          </ul>
          <li class="HListHeader">Game:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The game starts with ships placement, players can do it manually, or let the game place them randomly</li>
            <li>Each player has one shot in turn, regardless of whether they hit a ship, sunk it or not</li>
            <li>Each cell can only be shot at once, you do not lose your turn when you try to shoot at a cell that has already been shot at</li>
            <li>In hotseat mode, between players' turns, there is a "blindfold" screen allowing players to change places fairly. Player change is completed, when the next player inputs "ready" on the "blindfold" screen</li>
            <li>In the game against AI, AI's turn happens automatically without showing its board</li>
            <li>The game ends when all of one player's ships had been sunk</li>
          </ul>
          <li class="HListHeader">The how to's:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To start the game, in main menu select gamemode you want to play</li>
            <li>If you choose "Play against AI" select AI's difficulty level</li>
            <li>Choose whether you want to place your ships on board manually, or let the game randomly choose thier locatioin for you (Repeat this step for second player in hotseat mode)</li>
            <li>If you choose to place your ships manually, place them in descending order sorter by thier sizes, by inputing thier coordinates seperated by spaces in given format [DIR COL ROW] where:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>DIR - direction of the sihp:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>| (pipe) - ship will be placed vertically downwards from [COL ROW] coordinates</li>
                <li>- (minus) - ship will be placed horizontally to the right from [COL ROW] coordinates</li>
              </ul>
              <li>COL - column in which ship will be placed [A - J]</li>
              <li>ROW - row in which ship will be placed [1 - 10]</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Take your turn: take a shot at any coordinates that have not been shot at yet (cells that have been shot at are indicated by "â€¢" in them)</li>
            <li>Surrender your turn to the opponent, and play untill all of your or your opponents ships have been sunk</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
